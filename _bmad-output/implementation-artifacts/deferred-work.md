# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.5 (2026-09-03)

- **Misleading comment in `BlockAssigner`** — the comment above `SegmentControlSections` (`src/TextToXml/BlockAssigner.cs:15`) states "Members are ordered alphabetically (CC-4)" but the tuple array is ordered `Header / Detail / Footer` (structural order, not alphabetical). Introduced in Story 1.4. Either fix the comment or genuinely sort the array in a Story 1.2/1.4 follow-up hygiene pass.

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.4 (2026-09-03)

- **`DescriptorValidator` accepts a zero-width Segment field (`Size="0"`)** — `IsNonNegativeInteger` allows `0`, so `CheckSegments` slices an empty `rawValue` that never equals a non-empty marker and emits a `SegmentMismatch` warning on every Ligne of that Bloc. Pathological descriptor; fold into a broader Story 1.2 descriptor-validation hardening pass (reject zero-width fields, and possibly non-empty `*Marker` when `segmentField` is set).
- **`Windows1252(string)` test helper duplicated verbatim** between `BlockAssignmentTests` and `InputDecodingTests` (comment included). Extract into a shared test utility when a third copy appears.

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.1 (2026-09-02)

- **`.editorconfig` absent** — house style (English comments per `CLAUDE.md`, naming, redundant `using` directives despite `ImplicitUsings`) is unenforced. Add a repo `.editorconfig` as a dedicated hygiene task.
- **No CI workflow** — the `SolutionStructureTests` build gate and the `Category=Unit` / `Category=Integration` split only guard anything if a pipeline runs them on push. Fold into Story 2.1 (which already needs a Docker-capable runner, AR-12) or a dedicated CI story. Ties to risk R-1.
- **`Kape22Importer.Tests` has no executing test** — no DI smoke test that `Host.CreateApplicationBuilder` composes and `Worker` is registered as an `IHostedService`. Add when the worker is built out in Épic 3.
- **Worker template dead code** — `Program.cs` / `Worker.cs` are the unmodified `dotnet new worker` scaffold (`Task.Delay(1000)` sample loop, no `OperationCanceledException` handling on shutdown). Replace in Épic 3 (FR-12 / FR-13 orchestration).
