# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of story 2.1 (2026-09-04)

- **No CI job runs `Category=Integration`** — `ci.yml` now states outright that the runner providing a
  SQL Server test instance "is still an open infra decision". The AR-12 harness, the `scripts/schema`
  application and the EF round-trip therefore have no automated gate; only the `Category=Unit`
  model/parity tests run in CI. Decided during the review to accept this as a known deferral (D). Fold
  the runner choice (Linux service container vs Windows-native SQL) into the Epic 2 CI story; ties to
  risk R-1. When the job lands, also address the two items below.
- **The test schema is never reset between runs** — `scripts/schema/*.sql` guard every table with
  `IF OBJECT_ID(...) IS NULL` and `SqlServerIntegrationFixture` never drops. After any edit to
  `scripts/schema/`, an existing `AscoLSI_Test` / `MQTTnetServices_Test` keeps the stale tables and the
  integration tests pass against an outdated schema — exactly the R-3 failure mode, on the layer the
  file-vs-model parity test does not cover. Add a fixture drop/recreate of the four harness tables (or
  a documented reset step) when the integration CI job is built.
- **`MQTTnetServices.dbo.Logs` / `WorkerSettings` have no EF entity and no `SchemaModelParityTests`
  coverage** — R-3 drift protection currently exists only for `L_D_KAPE22` and `L_D_LOG_COMMANDE`.
  Extend parity (or add a lightweight column check) when Story 3.3 introduces the Serilog / launcher
  persistence.
- **Schema extraction is not reproducible** — the `.sql` headers describe the `sqlcmd` /
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` + `sys.identity_columns` method but no extraction script or query is
  committed, so R-3's "regenerate from the same source if the production schema changes" cannot be
  followed mechanically. Commit the extraction query (or a small script) alongside `scripts/schema/`.
- **MQTTnetServices connection string is not wired into production configuration** — Story 2.1 AC
  bundles `AscoLSI` **and** `MQTTnetServices` as "read from `IConfiguration`", but only `AscoLSI` has a
  production reader (`AddAscoLsiPersistence`) and a unit test. Decided during the review to defer the
  MQTT wiring to Epic 3, where its entities land; the misleading `AscoLsiConnectionConfigTests` comment
  was corrected in this pass.
- **Second test-isolation regime (commit + reset via Respawn / TRUNCATE) is not built** — only
  `TransactionScope` + rollback exists. `SqlServerIntegrationFixture` documents that commit + reset is
  "the caller's job" but provides no helper. Decided during the review to defer until Story 2.8 (the
  anti-duplicate guard, D22) — the first test that needs committed state.
- **Importer host does not compose persistence** — `Program.cs` never calls `AddAscoLsiPersistence`
  and `appsettings.json` carries no `ConnectionStrings:AscoLSI` placeholder. The extension exists and
  is unit-tested in isolation. Decided during the review to defer host wiring to the story that first
  consumes the `DbContext` (2.4 / 2.8); revisit `AddDbContext` vs `AddDbContextFactory` there, since
  the only current consumer (`Worker`) is a singleton.
- **`SqlServerIntegrationFixture` GO-batch splitter has no unit test** — the `BatchSeparator` regex is
  private and only exercised by the integration path (which itself has no CI gate). Extract the
  splitter into a small internal helper and add a `Category=Unit` test over the real `scripts/schema/`
  files so the parsing half is guarded without a database.

## Resolved: Epic 1 retrospective hygiene pass (2026-09-04)

Closed by the "story 0" hygiene pass (retro action `epic-1-retro-item-1`), commit pending:

- **Test-fixture helpers duplicated** (`Windows1252` ×5, `Row` ×2, `ReadDescriptor` / `ReadInput` /
  `FileRoot` / `Root` / `Ascii` across 4+ files) — folded into
  `tests/TextToXml.Tests/TestSupport.cs`, imported per file with `using static`. The
  `Windows1252` helper now uses the real `Encoding.GetEncoding(1252)` (provider registered in a
  static ctor) instead of the ASCII byte cast, so the name is honest. Notes from reviews 1.4, 1.6,
  1.7, 1.8.
- **Bloc→section-name mapping duplicated three times** (`BlockAssigner.SegmentControlSections`,
  `LineLengthChecker.SectionByBlock`, `NormalizedXmlBuilder.SectionByBlock`) — replaced by a single
  `src/TextToXml/DescriptorSections.cs` (`For(Block)` + `All` + name constants), also used by
  `DescriptorValidator.SectionNames`. Note from review 1.6.
- **Misleading comment in `BlockAssigner`** (`"Members are ordered alphabetically (CC-4)"` above a
  structurally-ordered array) — the array moved to `DescriptorSections.All`, comment rewritten. Note
  from review 1.5.

Still open from those same notes: unifying `Position` / `Size` offset access (three parsing styles
across the pipeline) — deferred, no Epic 2 payoff yet.

Landed (retro action `epic-1-retro-item-2`): repo `.editorconfig` + `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
(`dotnet build -warnaserror` with `EnforceCodeStyleInBuild` + `dotnet test --filter Category=Unit`),
and `AcTraitCoverageTests` — the AC→`[Trait]` aggregator gate (Story 3.6 pulled forward): the build
fails if a test named after an `AC` / `CTR` / `NFR` lacks the matching `[Trait]`. Closes the story 1.1
notes on absent `.editorconfig` and absent CI.

Landed (retro action `epic-1-retro-item-3`, PRD reconciliation): `PRD.md` §3 glossary and the FR-1
descriptor grammar now list `decimalSeparator` and `convert` on `<value>`; the `decimal` / `datetime`
canonical forms and the "datetime requires a `convert` mask" rule are captured as §0bis **D28** plus
`AC-FR1-14` / `AC-FR5-15`. Closes the review 1.8 note on the glossary.

Decided (retro action `epic-1-retro-item-3`): the blank-typed-Champ question from the review 1.6 note
is resolved as §0bis **D27** — `P60.xsd` types `int` / `decimal` / `datetime` Champs strongly
(`minOccurs="0"`), so Étape 1 **omits** the element for a blank typed Champ instead of emitting
`<Id></Id>`; the DTO gets `int?` / `decimal?` / `DateTime?`. `string` Champs keep the empty element.

Landed (retro action `epic-1-retro-item-7`): `NormalizedXmlBuilder.Normalize` now returns a nullable
canonical value — `null` for a blank `int` / `decimal` / `datetime` Champ — and `Build` skips the
element when it is null. `AC-FR5-4` / `AC-FR5-6` tests updated (`Convert_IntChampBlank_OmitsElement`,
`Convert_TrailingIntChampAbsent_OmitsElement`, `Convert_Decimal/DatetimeChampBlank_OmitsElement`).
Closes the review 1.6 note "Blank int Champ emits `<Id></Id>` which will not deserialize into a
non-nullable `int` DTO member".

Landed (retro action `epic-1-retro-item-4`): `AC-FR6-5` — `DescriptorValidator.Validate` no longer
concatenates the English `XmlException.Message` for a not-well-formed Descripteur; it emits
`"Le descripteur XML n'est pas bien formé (ligne N, position M)."`, keeping only the language-neutral
location. `AssertCleanFrenchMessage` now also rejects English framework-text tokens. Closes the
review 1.7 note.

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.8 (2026-09-03)

- **`datetime` canonical output truncates sub-second precision and has no timezone strategy** — `NormalizedXmlBuilder.NormalizeDateTime` always emits `yyyy-MM-dd[THH:mm:ss]`; a `convert` mask carrying `f`/`F` (fractional seconds) or `z`/`K` (offset) would silently lose that component or risk a local-timezone shift. No descriptor in the repo uses such a mask (`P62.xml` masks are `ddMMyy` / `dd/MM/yy HH:mm` style). Revisit when a format needs sub-second or offset-bearing timestamps.
- **AC-FR1-9 genericity is only proven for the "no header, no footer, no Segment" shape** — `fixtures/generic/message-only.xml` follows Annexe A.4 literally. The AC also mentions "présence header/footer différents de P60"; a second synthetic fixture with a non-P60 header/footer and Segment control (non-P60 markers) would exercise that path directly. Header/footer handling is currently covered only indirectly via the KAPE22-like descriptors in `NormalizedXmlTests` / `DescriptorValidationTests`.
- **PRD glossary §3 does not list `decimalSeparator` (nor `convert` on a `<value>`)** — the glossary Champ definition still reads `<value Id Position Size datatype [convert] Description>` and states the attribute list is exhaustive, but Story 1.8 consumes `decimalSeparator` and CTR-1 names it. Update the PRD glossary and the FR-1 descriptor grammar so descriptor and spec agree.
- **Implied-scale decimal (`convert` on a `decimal` Champ) is out of scope for v1** — `NormalizeDecimal` is driven by `decimalSeparator` only; a fixed-width field like `SerrageBil` `Section` (`convert="{0:000.0}"`, raw `1234` meaning `123.4`) would normalize to `1234`. Deliberate per the Story 1.8 contract decision. Implement when a live format requires an implied decimal point.
- **AC-FR16-2 has only a proxy assertion** — `FormatIsolationTests.TextToXml_CarriesNoFormatArtifact_AcFr16_2` checks the library side (no `.xml`/`.xsd`/`EmbeddedResource` in `src/TextToXml`) but does not enumerate the format variation points or scan `Kape22Importer` types for P60 literals, because those artifacts do not exist yet. Strengthen the test in Epic 2 once `P60.xml`/`P60.xsd`/the DTO/the entity exist.
- **New test-fixture helpers duplicated** — `ReadDescriptor` / `ReadInput` / `Message` / `FileRoot` are copied between `ExtendedTypesTests` and `GenericFormatTests`, extending the existing story 1.7 note on `Windows1252` / `Row`. Fold all fixture-path plumbing onto `RepoLayout` (or a `GenericFixtures` helper) in the same hygiene pass.

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.7 (2026-09-03)

- **Test helpers `Windows1252(string)` and `Row(...)` duplicated verbatim across 4+ test files** — `ConversionResultContractTests`, `NormalizedXmlTests`, `LineLengthTests`, `BlockAssignmentTests`, `InputDecodingTests` each carry their own copy (comments included). Extends the story 1.4 deferred note ("extract into a shared test utility when a third copy appears" — that threshold is now passed). When extracting: `Windows1252(string)` is actually an ASCII / Latin-1 byte cast (`text.Select(c => (byte)c)`), **not** CP1252 — bytes 0x80–0x9F map wrong (`€`, `Œ`, `™`, …). Rename to make the ASCII-only scope explicit, or switch to `Encoding.GetEncoding(1252)`. Reason: pre-existing pattern, not introduced by story 1.7, not blocking.
- **`LayoutInvalid` from a malformed descriptor embeds the raw `XmlException.Message` (English framework text)** — `DescriptorValidator.Validate` (`src/TextToXml/DescriptorValidator.cs:34`) produces `"Le descripteur XML n'est pas bien formé : <XmlException.Message>"`; the tail is English ("Unexpected end of file has occurred..."). Tension with AC-FR6-5 ("Message ... en français"). Introduced in story 1.2. The story 1.7 `AssertCleanFrenchMessage` check passes on the French prefix. Consider a fully French rendering (own wording for the well-formedness failure, or map common `XmlException` cases) in a story 1.2 hardening pass.

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.6 (2026-09-03)

- **`decimal` / `datetime` datatypes are silently treated as `string`** — `NormalizedXmlBuilder.Normalize` only special-cases `int`; `decimal` and `datetime` (both accepted by `DescriptorValidator`) fall through to `TrimEnd` and are emitted unnormalized. Story 1.8 (CTR-1/CTR-2) owns their normalization; no current descriptor or fixture uses them (D6: P60 has none), so not reachable today.
- **Blank `int` Champ emits `<Id></Id>` which will not deserialize into a non-nullable `int` DTO member** — tension between AC-FR5-4 ("" → empty element) / AC-FR5-6 and AC-FR5-12 ("deserializable without a custom converter"). To be resolved by the `P60.xsd` nullability / `minOccurs` decision in Story 2.3. AC-FR5-4 mandates the empty element for now.
- **Typed non-last Champ can be silently truncated** — `LineLengthChecker` (Story 1.5) only guarantees a non-last Champ's *starting* Position is covered, so `NormalizedXmlBuilder.ExtractRawValue` can clamp a middle Champ's slice mid-content (e.g. `"005"` out of `"0059000"`), and an `int` field then normalizes that to a plausible but wrong number. Pipeline-wide design point (FR-4 only requires start Position). Consider validating full declared `Size` for typed non-last Champs in a Story 1.5 / Épic 2 hardening pass.
- **Bloc→section-name mapping now duplicated three times** — `BlockAssigner.SegmentControlSections` (tuple array), `LineLengthChecker.SectionByBlock` (dict) and `NormalizedXmlBuilder.SectionByBlock` (identical dict). Extract one shared accessor in a hygiene pass; ties to the existing deferred note on the `BlockAssigner` comment.
- **Per-Ligne rework in `NormalizedXmlBuilder.Build`** — the section lookup, `.Elements("value")` enumeration and `int.Parse` of `Position` / `Size` are redone for every Detail Ligne (O(lignes × champs) tree walks and parses). Precompute the champ list and parsed offsets per section once. Trivial for P60 (3 Lignes); revisit if NFR-2 (500 Fichiers < 30 s) shows pressure.
- **Inconsistent offset access across the pipeline** — `NormalizedXmlBuilder` and `LineLengthChecker` re-parse `Position` / `Size` with `int.Parse((string)attr, NumberStyles.None, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)`, while `BlockAssigner` uses the `(int)attribute` cast. Unify via a single accessor on the validated Descripteur in the same hygiene pass.

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.5 (2026-09-03)

- **Misleading comment in `BlockAssigner`** — the comment above `SegmentControlSections` (`src/TextToXml/BlockAssigner.cs:15`) states "Members are ordered alphabetically (CC-4)" but the tuple array is ordered `Header / Detail / Footer` (structural order, not alphabetical). Introduced in Story 1.4. Either fix the comment or genuinely sort the array in a Story 1.2/1.4 follow-up hygiene pass.

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.4 (2026-09-03)

- **`DescriptorValidator` accepts a zero-width Segment field (`Size="0"`)** — `IsNonNegativeInteger` allows `0`, so `CheckSegments` slices an empty `rawValue` that never equals a non-empty marker and emits a `SegmentMismatch` warning on every Ligne of that Bloc. Pathological descriptor; fold into a broader Story 1.2 descriptor-validation hardening pass (reject zero-width fields, and possibly non-empty `*Marker` when `segmentField` is set).
- **`Windows1252(string)` test helper duplicated verbatim** between `BlockAssignmentTests` and `InputDecodingTests` (comment included). Extract into a shared test utility when a third copy appears.

## Deferred from: code review of story 1.1 (2026-09-02)

- **`.editorconfig` absent** — house style (English comments per `CLAUDE.md`, naming, redundant `using` directives despite `ImplicitUsings`) is unenforced. Add a repo `.editorconfig` as a dedicated hygiene task.
- **No CI workflow** — the `SolutionStructureTests` build gate and the `Category=Unit` / `Category=Integration` split only guard anything if a pipeline runs them on push. Fold into Story 2.1 (which already needs a Docker-capable runner, AR-12) or a dedicated CI story. Ties to risk R-1.
- **`Kape22Importer.Tests` has no executing test** — no DI smoke test that `Host.CreateApplicationBuilder` composes and `Worker` is registered as an `IHostedService`. Add when the worker is built out in Épic 3.
- **Worker template dead code** — `Program.cs` / `Worker.cs` are the unmodified `dotnet new worker` scaffold (`Task.Delay(1000)` sample loop, no `OperationCanceledException` handling on shutdown). Replace in Épic 3 (FR-12 / FR-13 orchestration).
